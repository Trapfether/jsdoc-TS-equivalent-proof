# jsdocExample

Jsdoc is powerful. Few people have kept up to date with the new developments. Particularly the collaborative work between the [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/), and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) teams. This is a demonstration of the power that jsdoc now has thanks to the hard work of these teams.

## Usage

Clone this repo to your local machine and use an up to date version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to open the folder. That's it.

What you should see is 5 errors in the `src/index.js` file. These are typescript type errors being picked up in regular js files. This repo is utilizing template types, recurisve types, the infer directive, and more.
